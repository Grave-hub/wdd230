            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <h4>Amazon</h4>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a>
            <img src="lesson2images/rsz_amazon_scrn.png" alt="mobile screenshot of amazon.com">
            <p>Hick's law states the more stimuli (options) offered to a user, the longer it takes to make decisons. 
                This can be interpreted to mean not to clutter up a page with too many options for a user otherwise they will find the layout confusing and uncomfortable. One 
                example of a website that doesn't overload it's users wtih options is Amazon, because in both it's mobile and browser views it has a limited number of options
                and puts further selections under menus only viewable once the user clicks on them.

            <h3>Proximity</h3>
            <p>Unilever</p>
            <a href="https://www.unilever.com/">Unilever.com</a>
            <img src="lesson2images/rsz_unilever_scrn2.png" alt="mobile screenshot of Unilever.com">
            <p>Proximity is the distance beteen objects on a page, and can convey different meanings depending on said distance. For example the website for Unilever has placed a greater
                emphasis on the different titles by seperating them into different groups. The Q1 results are not in the same area as the corporate slogan below it, seperating
                them from one another. Another design choice involving proximity is the Unilever logo, because it uses many small icons in close proximity forming
                the letter U to convey a quality feel.

            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <p>Placed Atoms</p>
            <a href="https://placedatoms.com/">placedatoms.com</a>
            <img src="lesson2images/rsz_screenshot_25.png" alt="mobile screenshot of placedatoms.com a site for creator Giaco Whatever">
            <p>Contrast is the difference between two objects, and in design it usually refers to size or color. For instance a stark page with nothing on it could put
                emphasis on whatever is placed at the center of it drawing all attention to the object. One website that I found tht uses contrast well is placedatoms by a youtuber who likes to
                build things. The contrast is sharp with the color scheme following white vs black. With just these two simple colors, the creator is able to dras the user's eyes to important
                objects, like buttons or dates.
